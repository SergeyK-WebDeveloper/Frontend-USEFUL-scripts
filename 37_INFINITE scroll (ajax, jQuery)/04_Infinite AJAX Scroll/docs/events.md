# Events

Infinite Ajax Scroll provides a wide range of events which we can use to hook into its functionality and customize where needed.

## Working with events

You can bind and unbind to events with the `on`, `once` and `off` methods.

```javascript
let ias = new InfiniteAjaxScroll('.container', options);

function handler(event) {
  console.log('New items have been appended', event);
}

ias.on('appended', handler);
ias.off('appended', handler);
ias.once('appended', handler);
```

## Reference

### binded

This event is triggered when Infinite Ajax Scroll binds to the scroll and resize events of the scroll container. This mostly happens right after the DOM is ready, but this can be configured with the `bind` option.

### unbinded

Triggered when Infinite Ajax Scroll removed its listeners from the scroll and resize events.

Infinite Ajax Scroll will only unbind when we call the `unbind` method.

### scrolled

Triggered when the user scrolls inside the scroll container.

| property | type | description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| scroll.y | integer | Current vertical scroll position from the top of the page (can be negative) |
| scroll.x | integer | Current horizontal scroll position from the left of the page (can be negative) |
| scroll.deltaY | integer | Delta between current vertical scroll position and previous position |
| scroll.deltaX | integer | Delta between current horizontal scroll position and previous position |

The delta values can be used to determine the scroll direction. A positive value means scrolling down (deltaY) or to the right (deltaX). A negative value means the opposite direction.

### resized

Triggered when the user resizes the scroll container.

| property | type | description |
