/**
 * Responsive pure CSS tabs & accordion
 * Without position absolute & with a selected state
 */

/**

A lot of CSS tabs need either the tab content or labels to be position absoluted, or sacrifice the selected state on the tabs.

This uses flexbox and order to have both.

It also allows you to drop down to an accordion when on mobile.
