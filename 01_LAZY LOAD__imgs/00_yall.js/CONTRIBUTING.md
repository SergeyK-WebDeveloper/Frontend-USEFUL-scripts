# Contributing guidelines

Hello! If you're reading this, you're probably interested in contributing to yall.js. This file sets the ground rules for contributions so you don't end up wasting our time.

First and most important, _please_ file an issue rather than submitting unsolicited pull request(s). Unsolicited pull requests will almost certainly be rejected or left to languish, _unless_ they fix a bug.

If you wish to extend yall.js to add functionality that's useful for you and want to merge it into this repo, I can't guarantee that I'll say yes. Opening an issue first starts a discussion where I can figure out if the request is something I want to take on or delegate. Additionally, yall.js is very fast in part because it's very small. Any major feature requests are likely to be rejected if the scope of the proposed functionality will significantly add to the final build size.

Finally, I am under no obligation to fix any bugs you might file, consider any new features you may suggest, or merge any pull requests you may submit. Why? _For any reason I feel like._ This project is a hobby of mine, and I don't get paid for it. You are not my client. You are a consumer of what I'm offering for free on the internet.

If your company uses yall.js and is interested in support, you have two options:

1. Fork the project and write the functionality you require (recommended).
2. [Reach out to me](https://jeremy.codes/contact/) and we'll discuss payment options for support services. It's probably not going to be cheap.

If anything is unclear here, file an issue and let's talk.
